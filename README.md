# User Intent Prediction in Information-seeking Conversations
This is the implementation for the paper "User Intent Prediction in Information-seeking Conversations". This paper has been accepted to CHIIR 2019. If you use this code for your paper, please cite our work.

Our models predict user intent for utterances in information-seeking conversations with the [MSDialog](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/msdialog/) data. In other words, the models conduct utterance type classification. One utterance can have more than one user intent label. These models are built with Keras.
